* Your Ethereum address will be whitelisted after successful registration.
* Registration is open at https://etherisc.com/registration and will stay open until TGE ends.

Token Sale phases

* Phase 1 allows contributions up to an individual cap per registered address. Phase 1 will last 5 days until Saturday, 30 June 2018 15:00 UTC.

How to contribute

1) Check your registration status at etherisc.com by entering your Ethereum address and clicking the button “Check your Registration”.

If your address has been successfully whitelisted, you will see your maximum contribution amount for phase 1 in ETH. The standard maximum contribution amount for registered participants is 50 ETH. You can also see how much ETH you have already contributed, and your DIP token balance.

Early Contributors might have higher maximum contribution amounts and — if they agreed to lock up DIP tokens for one year — will also see the applicable bonus.

CFI token holders might also have higher maximum contributions. For details regarding the CFI holders, please refer to the cofound.it blog post https://blog.cofound.it/etheriscs-tge-exclusive-offer-for-cofound-it-community-members-85b27d27519.

2) Fund your whitelisted address with the ETH amount you want to contribute. Remember to add a little for gas if you want to contribute the full amount.

3) Prepare the ETH transaction to the token sale contract address.

Stay safe

Always double check the token sale contract address before submitting the transaction. Verify the address from multiple sources: The address will be published in this blog post and on our website https://etherisc.com. When using ENS, always check that the ENS name resolves to the correct address.

The address will also be confirmed before the Token Sale starts in pinned messages on our Twitter account https://twitter.com/etherisc and in our Telegram community channel https://t.me/etherisc_community. More security advice can be found here https://myetherwallet.github.io/knowledge-base/getting-started/protecting-yourself-and-your-funds.html. If you notice suspicious activity, please let us know!

4) Submit the ETH transaction!

5) Note the transaction id and wait for the transaction to be mined. You can monitor the transactions on https://etherscan.io/address/tokensale.etherisc.eth

6) Once your transaction was successfully mined, check the status of your address again on etherisc.com. You will immediately see your DIP token balance. You can also check your DIP token balance on https://etherscan.io/token/0xc719d010b63e5bbf2c0551872cd5316ed26acd83#balances.

You can also verify the source code of the token sale contract on etherscan.io. The token sale smart contract code was audited in three independent audits.

In case you encounter any issues at any of the stages during the contribution process, please reach out to us on Telegram or contact us by email to support@etherisc.zendesk.com.

RSC token holders

RSC token holders were among the earliest supporters of Etherisc and will be able to convert their RSC tokens to DIP after the DIP Token Sale has ended. There will be a separate smart contract for this. Please don’t send RSC to the DIP Token Sale contract. We will publish a separate blog post with more details after TGE has started.
